What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked was that we got used to working in git and making commits, pushing, and pulling code. We also communicated well over text and in person about what progress we made on the code and which porblems needed to be fixed. TA hour was also very helpful for correcting 
our mistakes in understanding the assignment. 

What didn't work was that we did not do pair programming, as it was hard to find a time in our 
schedules where we could sit down together long enough to make significant progress. We also 
ran into problems where we initially wrote the code in oo_resale_shop.py by importing functions from procedural_resale_shop.py instead of re-implementing them in an 
object oriented way. We also had trouble with using a constructor to create the inventory dictionary instead of creating the inventory outside of the ResaleShop class.
