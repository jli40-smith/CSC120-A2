Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Joanna Li: 
What worked was that we got used to working in git and making commits, pushing, and pulling code. We also communicated well over text and in person about what progress we made on the code and which problems needed to be fixed. TA hour was also very helpful for correcting our mistakes in understanding the assignment and with learning how to debug with "pass". We went to get help with setting up constructors and for fixing 
bugs related to syntax. 

What didn't work was that we did not do pair programming, as it was hard to find a time in our schedules where we could sit down together long enough to make significant progress. 
We also ran into problems where we initially wrote the code in oo_resale_shop.py by importing functions from procedural_resale_shop.py instead of re-implementing them in an 
object oriented way. We also had trouble with using a constructor to create the inventory dictionary instead of creating the inventory outside of the ResaleShop class. 

To someone taking this course, I'd recommend using the internet to look up what __init__ means, and reviewing how data types and syntax work in Python. I would also highly recommend talking to different TAs 
at TA hours and checking your code against the rubric and requirements of the assignment very carefully even after you think you are done with the assignment. Using Git and Github to back up code to a repository  is also something I would recommend.
